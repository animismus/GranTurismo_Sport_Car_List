# GranTurismo Sport Car List
#### Updated ASAP with each new game content

#### - Parsed from GT Planet
The guys at GT Planet have a [great list](https://www.gtplanet.net/gran-turismo-sport-car-list/) that is updated when new content is added to the game. I just parse it and make it available in simple formats.


#### - SQLite DB

    cols: brand, year, model, version
<small>where version is the version of the game</small>

#### - JSON

    [
     {"model": "Abarth 1500 Biposto Bertone B.A.T. 1", 
     "version": "1.25", 
     "brand": "ABARTH", 
     "year": "1952"}, 
    ...]
